    "vulnerability_index": 7,
    "reasons": [
        "Potentially High Risk of Disclosure - The presence of publicly accessible files on 'unthinkable.me' raises concerns about potential risk of data exfiltration or unauthorized access. This is exacerbated by the use of `Fastly`, which can introduce further vulnerabilities if not properly secured.",
        "Lack of Robust Security Controls -  The use of static content rendering (Jekyll, Github Pages) and lack of dynamic content security measures on these subdomains leaves a significant vulnerability to automated attack vectors. The absence of specific security configurations or the lack of an up-to-date .htaccess for file-based authorization could potentially expose vulnerabilities.",
        "Missing Transparency & Logging - Absence of relevant logs for system activity raises concerns about incident response and potential data loss. Lack of detailed information on how 'unthinkable.me' approaches security compliance, especially in the presence of a past hack attack event in data/unthinkable.me/hackedlist_unthinkable.me.txt could create opportunities for attackers."
    ],
    "recommendations": [
        "Implement automated endpoint security measures: Secure endpoints against known attacks and threats like cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection that may compromise sensitive information.",
        ".htaccess configuration tailored for file authorization must be implemented to restrict unauthorized access. Implement HTTPS to reduce the susceptibility for data breaches during public requests.",
        "Utilize intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDPS) or next-generation firewalls with real-time analysis to proactively identify and respond to suspicious activity. "
